Web application for computation of parameters of radio-propagation models. 
Every model has its own intuitive interface that allows a user an easy interaction with the respective user interface and computation. Parameters are checked and, if there are errors, the user will be warned. 
Some models have a graphical representation of the results. 
Automatic units conversion allows for representation of data in different SI units.
